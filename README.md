FOI Disclosure Log Scraper - Department of Health
=================

A scraper for the Australian Government's Department of Health FOI Disclosure Log.

This is a scraper for the Australian Government [Department of Health FOI Disclosure Log](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/foi-disc-log). 

It is designed to run on [Morph.io](https://morph.io/), which hosts and runs the scraper.

[Morph.io](https://morph.io/) also provides a really helpful API to output data from the scraper.

### FOI Link

This is the link the scraper is looking at. If the page is old (a previous year), non-existant or broken the scraper won't work. Open an issue with the new link and I'll fix. Thanks!
